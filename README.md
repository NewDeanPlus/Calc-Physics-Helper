# Experimental Calc & Physics Helper
This is a project I've been working on to help me cement my understanding in java as well as helping me review a bunch of stuff from calc and physics classes that I barely remember.

###  - IN PROGRESS - 
- develop engine to solve various math problems from scratch
  - basic derivation
  - more complicated derivative rules like chain rule
  - solve derivative problems while identifying best techniques to use

###  - TO DO - 
- add functionality for solving algebra problems
- add functionality to apply physics formulas and variables to solve physics problems
- add review sections on topics from various subjects
- graphics
- trig
