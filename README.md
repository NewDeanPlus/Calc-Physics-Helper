# Experimental Calc & Physics Helper
This is a project I've been working on to help me cement my understanding in java as well as helping me review a bunch of stuff from calc and physics classes that I barely remember.

NOTE: I realize that it would be ridiculous to write a program to solve every single problem you might encounter in a calc or physics class, so I will likely just focus on derivative/integral rules and stuff like continuity. I plan on adding functionality for almost all types of physics problems eventually. Most of those are pretty consistent in format, so once I get the code working with all of the formulas and variables, I should be able to get those set up relatively quickly.

###  - IN PROGRESS - 
- develop engine to solve various math problems from scratch
  - basic derivation
  - more complicated derivative rules like chain rule
  - solve derivative problems while identifying best techniques to use
- work on setting up UI
  - general menus
  - connect settings to text file to save
  - connect graphics to backend math stuff for solving and problem generation

###  - TO DO - 
- add functionality for solving algebra problems
- add functionality to apply physics formulas and variables to solve physics problems
- add review sections on topics from various subjects
- graphics
- trig
